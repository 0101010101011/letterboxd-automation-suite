      "body": "I'm relocating to a new country, which means I need to pause sales temporarily after March 20th while I set up a new payment processor. If you know anyone who has been meaning to pick up the extension, tell them to grab it at the promotional price before the cutoff date! Don't worry, development will continue uninterrupted, and sales will be back online as soon as everything is set up."
